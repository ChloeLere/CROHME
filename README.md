# Crohme

## Description

This project tried to solve the problem of Recognition of Handwritten Mathematical Expressions, by comparing a SVC and a CNN on a multiclassification task.

## Execution 

In the project the dataset are already created, and transformed in png format, but if you want to see the scripted that have done that you can go into the folder `handwritten-mathematical-expressions` and see the script `inkml_to_png.py`.

To execute our project you should go into the `src` folder :

```bash
cd src/
```

And then you can execute our project by using our binary file :

```bash
./crohme
```

Little warning : our program wiil created and train quite a few model due to the parameters tuning, so it will take some time to finish computing everything.
